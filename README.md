# Usage
It will prompt user to input their answers about their project. When user finishes through the questions, it will generate a README file.

# Credits
Credits to Rochelle Ruiz! That's me! I did this project! I lost a bunch of my commits. I nearly lost all my codes due to trying to push the repo with a large file(video). I decided to delete the video out of the folder and pushed it back but the commit has teh video attached to it. I did some git commands which deleted all my codes. Finally we got it back and did it the cleanest way possible.
